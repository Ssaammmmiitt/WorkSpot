The growth of online job boards has expanded the pool of vacant positions for today’s job seekers. However, this abundance presents a new challenge: navigating a wide range of platforms, each with its own search functionality and listing format. This inefficiency, coupled with burden of tailoring applications for each platform, hinders a truly efficient job search.
